        Git commands:
        add : git add . <!--this . (shows all are included) u can also write file name-->
        commit : git commit -m "message" <!--message is mandatory (Whatever changes included u can write here)-->
        push : git push origin main <!--origin is the remote name and main is the branch name-->
        git status : git status <!--shows the status of the files-->
        if in case u create a  local file (file in vscode or any other editor) u cant push it directly to the github.
        for that first u need to create a repository in github (in ur profile) and then u need to copy that repository link, 
        1. git remote add origin "link" <!--this is the link of the repository paste it here in "link"-->
        2. git remote -v <!--to verify-->
        3. git branch <!--so here earlier branch name is master and u have to rename it as main-->
        4. git branch -m main <!--(name has changed to main now) -->

        also if u want to add and commit it together then u can use this command:
        git commit -am "message" <!--this will add and commit together-->
        for only add u can do either of the following:
        git add . 
        git commit -a

        for only commit u can do:
        git commit -m "message"

        for only push u can do:
        git push origin main

       also if u write git push -u origin main then u dont need to write origin main again and again. -u is used to set the upstream.
       after writing this u can directly write git push(instead of git push origin main) and it will push the changes to the main branch because
       after setting upstream -u (means origin or the place where data has sent is seted) so after that just wriying git push is enough.
    
      also if u handling multiple files and if u did some changes in one file and u want to push only that file then u can do this:
      first set file by : cd file_name
      then add and commit and push it.
