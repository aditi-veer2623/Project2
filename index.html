        Git commands:
        <p>add : git add . <!--this . (shows all are included) u can also write file name--></p>
        <p>commit : git commit -m "message" <!--message is mandatory (Whatever changes included u can write here)--></p>
        <p>push : git push origin main <!--origin is the remote name and main is the branch name--></p>
        <p>git status : git status <!--shows the status of the files--></p>
        <p>if in case u create a  local file (file in vscode or any other editor) u cant push it directly to the github.
        for that first u need to create a repository in github (in ur profile) and then u need to copy that repository link,</p>
        <p>1. git remote add origin "link" <!--this is the link of the repository paste it here in "link"--></p>
        <p>2. git remote -v <!--to verify--></p>
        <p>3. git branch <!--so here earlier branch name is master and u have to rename it as main--></p>
        <p>4. git branch -m main <!--(name has changed to main now) --></p>

        <p>also if u want to add and commit it together then u can use this command:</p>
        <p>git commit -am "message" <!--this will add and commit together--></p>
        <p>for only add u can do either of the following: </p>
        <p>1. git add . </p>
        <p>2. git commit -a </p>

        <p>for only commit u can do:</p>
        <p>git commit -m "message"</p>

       <p>for only push u can do:</p>
       <p>git push origin main</p>

      <p>also if u write git push -u origin main then u dont need to write origin main again and again. -u is used to set the upstream.
       after writing this u can directly write git push(instead of git push origin main) and it will push the changes to the main branch because
       after setting upstream -u (means origin or the place where data has sent is setted) so after that just writing git push is enough.</p>
    
      <p>also if u handling multiple files and if u did some changes in one file and u want to push only that file then u can do this:</p>
      <p>first set file by : cd file_name</p>
      <p>then add and commit and push it.</p>

      <p>if u want to make file directly in local device (here it is vscode) so for that u can use:</p>
      <p>command : mkdir folder_name <!--this will create a folder--></p>
      <!-- then u can create a file in that folder by:
      command : touch file_name <!--this will create a file in that folder-->
      <!-- then u can open that file by: 
      command : code file_name this will open the file in vscode --> -->


      <p> command: diff branch name <!--to compare commits, branches, files and more--></p>
      <p>command: git merge branch name  <!--to merge 2 branches--></p>
